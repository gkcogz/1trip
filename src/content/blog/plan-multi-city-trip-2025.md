## Introduction

Planning a **multi-city trip** sounds exciting — but it often turns into a stressful spreadsheet battle.  
Where should you start? How many nights in each city? How do you track transport costs and activities?  

This guide gives you a **clear, step-by-step method** to plan your next journey — and shows how tools like **OneTrip**, a modern multi-city trip planner, make it simple.

## 1. Choose Your Anchor Destinations 🎯

Don’t overwhelm yourself with too many stops.  
Start with 2–3 **anchor cities** you’re sure about (e.g., *Rome, Paris, Berlin*).  
From there, add nearby destinations if time and budget allow.

> Pro tip: Always balance **distance vs. time**. A cheap flight might cost you an entire day of travel.

## 2. Balance Nights vs. Transport 🚆✈️🚗🚌

The golden rule: **Spend more nights than travel hours.**  

- ✈️ Flights → best for long jumps between regions  
- 🚆 Trains → perfect in Europe for comfort + city-center arrivals  
- 🚌 Buses → ideal for budget travelers  
- 🚗 Cars → flexibility for hidden gems  

👉 With OneTrip’s **Stops & Transport view**, you can instantly visualize connections between each city.

## 3. Track Budget per Stop 💰

Each city has different costs. Break it down clearly:  
- 🏨 **Lodging** = per night × nights  
- 🍴 **Food** = daily cost × nights × people  
- 🎟️ **Activities** = attractions, tours, events  
- 🛒 **Other** = taxis, souvenirs, unexpected expenses  

OneTrip **automatically calculates per person totals** and group totals, so you always know what you’re spending.

## 4. Keep Activities Flexible 🗒️

Plan your must-sees but leave buffer time.  
Categorize activities into:  
- 🌿 Nature  
- 🍝 Food  
- 🎭 Culture  
- 🌃 Nightlife  

This way, you can adapt depending on weather, energy, or mood.

## 5. Share & Sync with Friends 🔗

Traveling with others? Stop the endless group chats.  
With OneTrip you can:  
- Generate a share link in one click
